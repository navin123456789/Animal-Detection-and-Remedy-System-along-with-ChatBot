# Animal-Detection-and-Remedy-System-along-with-ChatBot
This project focuses on the development of an Animal Detection and Remedy System, integrated with a ChatBot, designed to identify specific animals and suggest appropriate remedies based on the detection.
Key Features:

Animal Detection: Using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, the system can identify various animals in real-time. The model has been trained to detect the following animals:

Elephants
Cows
Buffaloes
Snakes
Goats
Dogs

Remedy Suggestions: Once an animal is detected, the system provides suggestions for handling or addressing any issues that the animal may be facing, such as first aid tips or environmental considerations.

Integrated ChatBot: A conversational ChatBot helps users interact with the system. Users can ask about animal-related issues, and the ChatBot will offer advice based on the animal detection and any pre-defined remedies.

Real-Time Detection and Interaction: The system processes images or video streams, detecting animals in real-time and responding with suitable guidance and remedies.

Technologies Used:

YOLO8n model with custom dataset for object detection
TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
Gradio for building the ChatBot interface
Python based overall project
This project is designed to help in situations where animals need immediate attention or where there is a risk of conflict between animals and human populations, like in agriculture, conservation, or urban areas.
